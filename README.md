# Helpjuice front-end developer test project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is an assessment exercise given to me by `Helpjuce`, a knowledge base software company during my application for the frontend developer role.

In this project, you should be able to state what type of element you want to create between the `H1` and `P` tag in the provided input field by pressing `/1` and a drop down will appear. The input field also listens for key combinations such as `#` + `space` as a shortcut for creating H1 elements.

The techonologies used are react, css modules, sass and typescript.
* Decided to use react instead of angular, cause:
- I'm more proficient at react when compared to angular
- There was a due date to beat
- I was free to use the stack of my choice

* Used sass for it provides a great way of debugging your css code, which regular css isn't able to do, plus other great advantages it comes with.
